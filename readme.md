This is a wrap-up file for my first project, the Simon game.

The technologies I used in completing this project are:
	1.	git
	2.	CSS
	3.	HTML
	4.	JavaScript
	5.	jQuery (decided not to use it, though I kind of learned some techniques)


The approach I took for this project was a functional approach. My code is not very object oriented. It consists of one main javascript file that contains all of the used functions. I focused on the logic part first and then did the layout features last. I first got a random array of answers, then I compared the answers to what the user entered. Based on their results, I alert them if they are correct or not.

My unsolved problems is that I wasnâ€™t able to slow down the blinking of the buttons on the screen. I believe jQuery had good methods for this but I was not able to implement that approach. I tried to delay/stall the rendering through Javascript but was unable to do so.
